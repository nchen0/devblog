Welcome to my blog about my experiences with Lambda School's Labs, a 5 week immersive capstone experience where students are split into small teams and assigned a project to work on.

### Front End Focus

This week was a hard week for us, needing to fully our final project before our capstone defense. This week I focused mostly on trying to sharpen all of our responsiveness and small bugs that we had on our website. I found several bugs and made a list to fix them all. There were some bugs with logging out and our guest user being not truly logged out. I had to dig into our code to debug why that's happening and realized that it was because our session and localStorage weren't cleared correctly. 

### Teamwork & Milestone Reflections

Teamwork was a huge part this week. We had to work together a lot this week to make sure our project was as polished as possible. I worked with Alex a lot to prepare for our demo and the rest of the team for a script on our video.
